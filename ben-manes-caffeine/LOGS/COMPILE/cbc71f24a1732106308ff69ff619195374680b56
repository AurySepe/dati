To honour the JVM settings for this build a single-use Daemon process will be forked. See https://docs.gradle.org/6.8.3/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon.
Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build 
checksum-dependency-plugin is disabled since checksumIgnore property is present
